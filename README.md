# DEV Environment

Here you can find the configuration files for tools I use in my laptop for developing. They are mainly:

- [Git](https://github.com/git/git)
- [i3](https://i3wm.org/docs/userguide.html)
- [Terminator](https://terminator-gtk3.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
- [VIM](https://github.com/vim/vim)

# Install

```
git clone https://github.com/al3xhh/dev.git --recursive
cd dev
./install.sh $(pwd)
```
